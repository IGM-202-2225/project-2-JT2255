- Obstacles - _List all obstacle types this state avoids_
- Seperation - _List all agents this state seperates from_
   
#### State Transistions

- _List all the ways this agent can transition to this state_
   - _eg, When this agent gets within range of Agent2_

-   _If an asset is from the Unity store, include a link to the page and the author’s name_

## Make it Your Own
